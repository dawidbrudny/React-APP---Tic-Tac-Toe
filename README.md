## General Information
- A project that includes a game of tic-tac-toe. The game was written in JSX and divided into several folders and components. You can play it by choosing one of two options. The first one is playing with another player on the same computer and the second one is opportunity to play with AI that is on the intermediate level. Finally, I performed a few tests to check what tests in React applications actually are (nothing major).
- When I was learning JavaScript and later React, I did not focus on the aesthetic side of my projects. Perhaps the biggest drawback of this application is that it is not responsive. The project only runs correctly on the desktop.
- The main goal of this project was to consolidate the knowledge from the course. I started learning React because it is the most popular framework when it comes to JavaScript.


## Technologies Used
- Create React App - ver. 2
- Jest - ver. 26.4


## Setup
- First, clone the repository using the "git clone" command in the CLI and then install Node Package Manager using the "npm install" command. There may be an issue during the second step, which will most likely be related to the Node version. In this case, you need to download and install NVM (Node Version Manager).
- ATTENTION! Install NVM on the same disk as the "nodejs" folder (preferably drive C), then you will avoid the problem of not being able to switch to another version despite a message suggesting that the switch has been completed. Another solution may be to change the name of the "nodejs" folder to something else, which will allow you to create a new shortcut and switch to a different version.
- The version you need to download is 16.20.2. You can download it after installing the NVM program. Enter the command in the CLI "nvm install 16.20.2" and then "nvm use 16" (you only need to enter 16).


## Room for Improvement
In the future, I would like to introduce a new difficulty level for AI - hard level. It may come with three difficulty options when playing against computer. For this purpose, I will probably have to focus on the MIN MAX algorithm, which, as I heard, is used in playing chess on a computer.

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ / _I will be work on it in the future_.
